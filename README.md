## üîë Features

### Backend Functionality

-   The backend scrapes data from [imot.bg](https://www.imot.bg/) and saves it to MongoDB Atlas.
-   Data is processed and stored, including property details and realtor information.
-   The backend serves as a central data repository for the frontend.

#### Local Scraper Setup

To run the scraper **locally**, follow these steps:

1.  Copy the contents of the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env` in the `backend` directory.

2.  Set your MongoDB connection string in the `MONGODB_URL` variable.

3.  Customize the `SECRET_TOKEN` in the `.env` file. This token is used to authenticate requests to initiate the scraping process.

4.  Open your terminal and navigate to the `backend` directory.

5.  Run the following commands to install dependencies and start the local server:

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

6.  Once the server is running and your database is connected, make a **GET** request to http://localhost:8000/api/scrape with your chosen API client (e.g., cURL or Postman) and include the **SECRET_TOKEN** in the request header. Ensure that the header is named `x-secret-token`.
